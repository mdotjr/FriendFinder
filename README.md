# FriendFinder
Welcome to FriendFinder! This is a compatibility-based application that takes in the users answers from a given survey, takes their score, and matches it with other candidates to see who would be their best fit for a friend.

# How doe it work?
The user fills out an information form about themselves displaying their name and adding a link to their photo. The user is given 10 survey questions based on personality traits. Once the user completes the survey, their score is then compared to the next candidate closest to what their answers were to display their potential match. The photo of their potential friend will pop up into the browser.
